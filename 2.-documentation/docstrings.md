# Docstrings

Professional documentation of Python is based on Docstrings. For any object, if I type **help(**_**object\_name**_**)** I get the associated docstring.

I can examine the directory of any object by typing **dir(**_**object\_name**_**)**. It is a bit messy, but I can see all the properties of int. One of those properties is **\_\_doc\_\_** as shown below.

I wrote the following simple programme. I called the function, that worked. I then asked for the associated docstring using help.

Useful!
