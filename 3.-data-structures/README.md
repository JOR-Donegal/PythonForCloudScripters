# 3. Data Structures

Before you begin, create a directory to keep example files in and you are ready to code.&#x20;

This could be on your OneDrive, in these examples, I am using **OneDrive\Python\Exercises\_03**&#x20;

I am using the command line interpreter (CLI) or interactive shell for some of these notes. This lets me run simple code and interpret the output immediately.&#x20;

I also use Notepad ++ for other exercises. Use the editor of your choice.
