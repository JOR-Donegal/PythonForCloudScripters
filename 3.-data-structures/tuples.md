# Tuples

Tuples are like lists, but immutable. Once an element has been assigned to a tuple, it cannot be changed.&#x20;

Tuples are defined by regular brackets.

There are some standard methods like count() and index().

I do not use tuples much but if I need to ensure integrity of a data set, they are perfect. It will not be possible to accidently change one value.&#x20;

## Exercise&#x20;

Try changing a value in the tuple using its index and verify it is immutable.
