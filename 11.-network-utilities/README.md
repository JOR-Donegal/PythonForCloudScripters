# 11. Network Utilities

These exercises are provided to demonstrate how to get started with network protocols in Python. I assume you have no knowledge of networking, but I do not explain terms in great detail. If a term has you confused, do some background research. Otherwise, identify what you do not know, this will be covered in the networking module.&#x20;

I’m also going to do things the simplest way possible. I’m going to use FTP instead of the secure version SFTP. In later sessions, I am going to use Telnet instead of SSH. Please note that in a real project you will always use the secure versions of these protocols. There is a real chicken-and-egg problem for me here, I do not plan to cover cryptography until the networking module.&#x20;

In these notes, I introduce UDP, TCP and multicast, without exhaustive explanation, this will be covered in the networking module. You will find very good [tutorials](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/) openly available.

Before you begin. create a directory to keep example files in and you are ready to code.&#x20;

This could be on your OneDrive, in these examples, I am using **OneDrive\Python\Exercises\_11**
