# Strings

Strings are sequences of characters surrounded by quotes. You can use either single or double quotes to demark the start and end of the sentence. In this way, you can include a single quote mark as a character.&#x20;

“This is a string”&#x20;

‘This is also a string’&#x20;

“This is a string with an internal quote mark of one type, which doesn’t count as a quote”

Strings are _immutable_, that means you cannot change the string; more on that later.
