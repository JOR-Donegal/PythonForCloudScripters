# Data Types

For reference, read [here](https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/stdtypes.html).

We have said that a variable refers to a location in memory which contains data. But there are many different types of data. For example, this sentence is a string of characters, we refer to text like this as a string.There are many ways we can represent numbers. If you wanted to store with the constant PI, to how many decimal places would you store it?

| Integers        | int     | Whole numbers                               | 400                       |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Floating Point  | float   | Numbers with a decimal                      | 2.134                     |
| Complex numbers | complex | Complex number with real and imaginary part | complex(12, 4)            |
| Strings         | str     | Ordered immutable sequence of characters    | “Yoo Hoo!”                |
| Lists           | list    | Ordered sequence of objects                 | \[12AUG22, “Euro”, 1.123] |
| Dictionaries    | dict    | Unordered Key:Value                         | {index:123, name:”JOR”}   |
| Tuples          | tup     | Ordered immutable sequence of objects       | (12AUG22, “Euro”, 1.123)  |
| Sets            | set     | Unordered collection of unique objects      | {“a”, “b”, “c”}           |
| Booleans        | bool    | Logical value                               | True                      |
