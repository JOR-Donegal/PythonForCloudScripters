# Coding with operators

I want to move away now from using the Python interpreter directly. I'm going to start writing simple code in an editor. I can't run the program from the editor, I'm going to do that from the command prompt.

1. Start a new sheet in Notepad ++
2. Create add.py as shown and run to test

1. Test all the operators in Arithmetic Operators and make sure they give the expected answer.

### Exercise <a href="#exercise" id="exercise"></a>

I created a very contrived programme to assign values to variables and print out the result. Using the same approach, write a programme to calculate your budget (budget.py) and expenditure for this semester. Do not use real numbers, keep this fictional!

Save your script, you will need to upload it later.
