# Escape Sequences

We have already seen the print function.

Normally, it inserts a line feed by default.

The default value of the end parameter of the print function is \n, so a new line character is appended to the string.

We could supress this.

Or we could include an escape sequence \n to do a multi-line print command on one line of code.

Escape sequences tell Python that the following character is a control character, not a letter.&#x20;

In this example, I use \n to tell Python I want a new line. I could use **\t** to insert a tab character.
