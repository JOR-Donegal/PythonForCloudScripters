# 7. Errors

Error handling is a key part of any script or program you run.

Some of my scripts are intended to run continuously. If they experience an error, I want them to handle it and continue.

In other cases, I may want to get detailed error messages and have the script stop execution.

Before you begin. create a directory to keep example files in and you are ready to code.&#x20;

This could be on your OneDrive, in these examples, I am using **OneDrive\Python\Exercises\_07**&#x20;
