# Finally

There are much more elegant ways to do some of this.&#x20;

For systems logging, read [this](https://realpython.com/python-logging/).&#x20;

There is a specific library for writing [CSV files](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html).&#x20;

I wanted to do all this the hard way!

I have code in navigation systems, survey equipment, satellite tracking systems, instrumentation systems, etc. that has used similar, very simple scripts to that which I showed here.&#x20;

I have a rule with systems which run 24x7 remotely……simplicity!
