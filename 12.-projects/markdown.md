# Markdown

We use markdown files as a simple way to write documentation, and there is always a **readme.md** in the root directory of any project. Each major section of the project might have additional notes.

I use headings, bold, italics, hyperlinks etc. You can do more complex things with markdown, but its supposed to be simple.

This is a rendered **readme.md** from one of my current projects, feel free to criticize!

This is incomplete and doesn't meet typical best practices.
