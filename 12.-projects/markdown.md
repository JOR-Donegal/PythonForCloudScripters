# Markdown

We use markdown files as a simple way to write documentation, and there is always a **readme.md** in the root directory of any project. Each major section of the project might have additional notes.

I use headings, bold, italics, hyperlinks etc. You can do more complex things with markdown, but its supposed to be simple.

Typically, I might use the following headings.

* Title
* Description
* How to install and run the project
* Dependencies
* Table of contents with links
* Credits
* License
* How to contribute
* Tests
