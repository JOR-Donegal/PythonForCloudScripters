# 1. Learning the basics

There are a few ways we can use Python. Usefully, we can type code into the interpreter and execute it immediately. In this section, that is how I want you to run code.

In Windows (or Linux!) open a terminal window and type **python**. In some versions of Linux, you need to type **python3**. And in some newer versions of Windows, you type **py**.

I will carry out my exercises using a Windows 11 desktop. You can carry out this work on almost any modern platform.

You should have already installed Python as per my notes.

You should have already installed Notepad ++ as per my notes.

Before you begin, create a directory to keep example files in.&#x20;

This could be on your OneDrive, in these examples, I am using **OneDrive\Python\Exercises\_01**&#x20;

I am using the command line interpreter (CLI) or interactive shell for some of these notes. This lets me run simple code and interpret the output immediately. You do not have to save that work, but do keep a record of the commands,

I also use Notepad ++ for other exercises. Use the editor of your choice and save the work.

In the notes, I mention _PEPs_ from time to time. These are _Python Enhancement Proposals_, the way we standardize and improve Python.
